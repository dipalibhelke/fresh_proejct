Everything in Git is checksummed before
it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum. 
This means it’s impossible to change the contents of any
file or directory without Git knowing about it. 
This functionality is built into Git at the lowest 
levels and is integral to its philosophy.
You can’t lose information in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it.
